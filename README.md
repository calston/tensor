Tensor
======

Tensor is now known as (https://github.com/calston/duct)[Duct]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calston/tensor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calston/tensor) [![Latest Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tensor/badge/?version=latest)](http://tensor.readthedocs.org)

Tensor is an event gateway, poller and router. It can collect metrics or events from multiple sources, and output them to multiple destinations - currently supprort for Elasticsearch and Riemann is included but Tensor is designed to be easily extensible through its plugin API.

(If you came looking for a maths framework I apologise for the deception.)
